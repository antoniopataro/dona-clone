# üìÉ Ô∏èDona Clone

This project is a clone of [Dona](https://dona.ai/), which is a To-Do List application focused on design.

I've always liked their design and decided to recreate their app.

This is kinda also of a refactor of an old To-Do App I've made, which you can see [here](https://github.com/antoniopataro/todo-app).

Feel free to share thoughts to me and get in touch.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

I created this project using `Vite` as its plugin. Chose `React` as framework and used `Typescript`, of course.

Styled the project using `Styled Components`, used `UUID` for unique IDs to each task or list, `React Beautiful DND` for Drag and Drop and `React Calendar` to build the calendar feature.

Since it is a clone, I decided to store everything inside user browser's `localStorage` and leave `Back-End` matters aside.
